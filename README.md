I don't quite know what goes in a readme. I'm just adding this here because Github asked me to.

It's pretty simple, really. I doubt much explanation is needed. The arrays hold the traits, the RandomGen() method takes a random part of those arrays and indexes them into a string, and the makeFrame() method creates the gui.

Feel free to simply use the program as is either for fun or content, play around with the code, or do what I intend to do with it and use it as a reference for your own projects for learning. 
Make sure to give credit to me (Echo Dextive) and feel free to let me know that you did somethging with it. I'd love to check out what you did!
